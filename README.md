Simple Jquery Ajax query to a pure PHP backend

The main idea, is to know a basic structure in order to perfom an ajax query using JQUERY in the front end, a pure PHP in the backend.

This basic project will help anyone thats just begings to use PHP and Jquery.

Hope this example can help explode your ideas.
